Launcher and patcher for Sim Theme Park!

## About Golden Ticket

Golden Ticket is a launcher for Sim Theme Park, which will automatically patch your game installation to run on any
PC running Windows Vista or newer<sup>1</sup>. It does so by changing out files in the game directory with modified versions
which have been tested to work on a majority of systems with positive repeatable results. Some files are also added to
make the game work \[better\], such as required fonts, cutscenes, and music.
